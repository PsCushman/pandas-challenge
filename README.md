Written analysis is in the directory named "analisys" in .pdf format.

I got help in two places from LAs when writing this code in Jupyter Notebook. One, I was having trouble using the pd.cut methond in the "School Spending" section because the Per Student Budget had already been formated and could not be run as an integer. So we discussed using the per_school_capita because it was used to create the Per Student Budget column but had not been formatted.

Also in the "Scores by School Type" section, I was having an issue using the provided code because I was utilizing the column names as I had in the "Scores by Size" section above. Although the provided code seemed redundant to me, we decided to remove the column references when calulating the mean so the provided code would run properly.
