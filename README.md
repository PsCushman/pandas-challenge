# pandas-challenge

Written analysis is in the directory named "analisys" in a Microsoft Word document.

I got help in two places from LAs when writing this code in Jupyter Notebook. One, I was having trouble using the pd.cut methond in the "School Spending" section because the Per Student Budget had already been formated and would not run. So we discussed using the per_school_capita dataframe because it was used to create the Per Student Budget column but had not been formatted. I also spoke to a tutor who suggested that, while it is smart to wait until all calulations had been done before formating, it is acceptable if not encouraged to use dataframes if and when it necessary to complete calculations when there are issues with formatting.

Also in the "Scores by School Type" section, I was having an issue using the provided code because I was utilizing the column names as I had in the "Scores by Size" section above. Although the provided code seemed redundant to me, we decided to remove the column references when calulating the mean so the provided code would run properly.

Lastly, I spoke to my instructor about the warning messages and she said that as long as the code runs that it was ok to submit.
